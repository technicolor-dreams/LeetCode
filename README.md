No one likes doing LeetCode. 
But the only worst then doing LeetCode is having to do 50+ questions the night before an interview. 
Even after doing 50+ questions, you don't remember a thing, 
and now you only have 3h to sleep before you have to do your interview. 
I can tell you right now that I have failed every time that was the scenario leading up to the interview.
No one wins when this happens. 
You look like a fool, the recruiter looks like a fool for putting their name on the line by recommending you, 
and the interviewer is just embarrassed for you, and the recruiter.

Now what if instead of cramming 50+ the week before an interview, you took the initiative to do 4-5 a day? 

That's what this experiment is for:

* Attempt question of the day.
* Do 3-4 more questions from any of the structured plans.
* Use the timer and record it in the Javadoc.

These days, you never know when you will be thrust back into the world of fun-employed.
Not all of us have guaranteed contracts like NFL coaches, so the faster we can bounce back, the better.
By doing 4-5 questions every day, when the time comes where you have to do interview prep, 
you can focus on the other parts of the technical interview instead of cramming 50+ questions, not getting any sleep,
and not remembering anything you prepared for.

My current language choice is Java. Now of course you should practice in the language you will be expected to use.
I am primarily a Java developer, so I am very familiar with all the builtin data structures (sorted/thread friendly/etc.)
which may or may not be builtin to other programming languages. 
I actually used to use JavaScript but switched to Java when most of my interviews were asking core Java questions 
so using Java was killing two birds with one stone.

I used to cringe everytime it came to preparing for technical interviews because I knew I hadn't touched LeetCode in months.
I am hoping to build a better relationship with this by being consistent. 
I will treat it as casually as a newspaper cross-word/sudoku but as consistent as brushing your teeth in the morning.

If you are reading this and the repo has no current activity, I better be dead because I am sticking to this for 2025 and beyond.

Thanks,

Matt
